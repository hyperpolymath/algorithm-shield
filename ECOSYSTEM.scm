  (position-in-ecosystem
    "Algorithm Shield is a practical tool that embodies hyperpolymath governance principles:"
    "- User agency over algorithmic manipulation"
    "- Transparency and narratability of automated actions"
    "- Polymorphism and metamorphism as strategies for autonomy"
    "- Differentially permeable membranes between contexts"
    ""
    "It sits in the 'tools for digital autonomy' cluster, alongside privacy tools,"
    "decentralized protocols, and anti-surveillance technologies."
    ""
    "Unlike passive ad blockers, Algorithm Shield is *active* and *programmable*.")

  (what-this-is
    "A browser extension for active resistance to algorithmic profiling."
    "A programmable membrane between user and engagement algorithms."
    "A tool for crossing filter-bubble boundaries intentionally."

  (what-this-is-not
    "Not a passive ad blocker (it actively perturbs algorithms)."
    "Not a VPN or anonymity tool (it doesn't hide your IP)."
    "Not a data exfiltration tool (it operates locally only)."
    "Not a 'hack' or 'cheat' (it uses normal browsing actions)."
    "Not a replacement for critical thinking (it's a tool, not a solution)."))
