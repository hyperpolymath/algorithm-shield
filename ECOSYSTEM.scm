  (position-in-ecosystem
    "Algorithm Shield is a practical tool that embodies hyperpolymath governance principles:"
    "- User agency over algorithmic manipulation"
    "- Transparency and narratability of automated actions"
    "- Polymorphism and metamorphism as strategies for autonomy"
    "- Differentially permeable membranes between contexts"
    ""
    "It sits in the 'tools for digital autonomy' cluster, alongside privacy tools,"
    "decentralized protocols, and anti-surveillance technologies."
    ""
    "Unlike passive ad blockers, Algorithm Shield is *active* and *programmable*.")
