== What is Algorithm Shield?

Ever feel like the internet is showing you the same things over and over? That's the "filter bubble" - algorithms learn what you click and show you more of the same, trapping you in an echo chamber.

Algorithm Shield helps you:

* **See beyond your bubble** - Discover content outside your usual patterns
* **Confuse the algorithm** - Your behavior becomes unpredictable
* **Stay in control** - You decide what you see, not the algorithm

[.lead]
_Like a VPN for your browsing behavior._

---

== Why This Matters

Filter bubbles aren't just an annoyance - they're **fragmenting our shared reality**.

When algorithms only show you content similar to what you've already seen, you lose the ability to understand people who think differently. Democratic discourse becomes impossible when we can't even agree on basic facts. Echo chambers don't just reinforce beliefs - they make it harder to recognize we're even in one.

**Most privacy tools try to hide from algorithms.** Algorithm Shield takes a different approach: it **confuses them**.

Instead of blocking trackers or masking your identity, it makes your behavior unpredictable. The algorithm can't pigeonhole you if you're constantly crossing boundaries it didn't expect. You're not invisible - you're **a shapeshifter**.

=== What Makes This Different

**Mathematically Proven Safety**: Unlike most software that's "tested and seems fine," Algorithm Shield uses formal verification. Core operations are mathematically proven to be crash-free (via https://github.com/hyperpolymath/proven[proven library]). Future versions will use https://github.com/hyperpolymath/ephapax[Ephapax] with Coq proofs for memory safety. When we say "unbreakable code," we mean it literally.

**Narratable by Design**: You always know what Algorithm Shield is doing and why. Every action comes with a human-readable explanation. No mysterious black boxes - just transparent tools you can understand and control.

**Privacy-Preserving**: All processing happens locally in your browser. No cloud services, no data collection, no tracking. Your browsing patterns stay yours.

**Respectful of Agency**: The tool asks permission before taking action. You're in control - Algorithm Shield is your assistant, not your replacement.

**Part of a Verified Ecosystem**: Algorithm Shield integrates with a broader ecosystem of formally verified tools - proven (crash-proof operations), Ephapax (linear types), Svalinn/Vörðr/Cerro Torre (verified container stack). It's not just one secure tool - it's part of a coherent vision where **mathematical certainty replaces "we think it's safe."**

=== The Bigger Picture

If platforms are using sophisticated algorithms to profile and manipulate us, we need tools with the same level of sophistication to resist. Not to hide, not to opt out completely - but to **stay human in an algorithmic world**.

The internet should expand your worldview, not narrow it. Algorithm Shield helps make that possible again.

== Core Features

=== 🔍 Bubble Detection

See what "cluster" the algorithm thinks you're in:

* Are you being shown mostly tech content? Politics? Lifestyle?
* How narrow is your current bubble?
* What adjacent topics are just out of reach?

=== 🚪 Membrane Crossing

One-click actions to break out of your bubble:

* **Opposition Lens** - Show me the opposite viewpoint
* **Random Walk** - Surprise me with something completely different
* **Time Shift** - What was popular last week/month/year?
* **Locality** - What's trending nearby geographically?
* **Serendipity** - Pure randomness

=== 🎭 Personas

Browse as different "people" to avoid lock-in:

* **Gardener** - Interested in plants, sustainability, cooking
* **Tech Skeptic** - Privacy-focused, critical of big tech
* **Art Student** - Creative, visual arts, culture

Switch between personas to see different recommendations. Your real interests stay private.

=== 🛡️ Stealth Mode

Make your browsing patterns less predictable:

* Automated "noise" clicks to confuse profiling
* Human-like timing (not robotic)
* Privacy-preserving (all actions stay local)

== How It Works

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Algorithm Shield Observes        │
│     "YouTube is showing you           │

└──────────────────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  2. You Choose an Action              │
│     Click "Opposition Lens"           │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  3. Shield Opens Diverse Content      │
│     "Here are 5 art/music videos"     │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
                │
                ▼
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  4. Algorithm Gets Confused           │
│     "Wait, are they a tech person     │
│      or an art person?"                │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result**: You see a wider variety of content. The algorithm can't pigeonhole you.

== FAQ

**Q: Is this like an ad blocker?**

A: No, it's complementary. Ad blockers hide trackers. Algorithm Shield confuses recommendation algorithms. Use both together!

**Q: Will platforms ban me for using this?**

A: No. Algorithm Shield uses normal browsing actions (clicks, scrolls, opens). It's indistinguishable from manual browsing because it *is* manual browsing - just automated with your permission.

**Q: Does it work on...?**

Current support:
- ✅ YouTube (v0.5+)
- 🔜 X/Twitter (v1.0)
- 🔜 Instagram (v1.0)
- 🔜 TikTok (v2.0)

**Q: Will it slow down my browser?**

A: No. The extension is very lightweight (<1MB). Rule evaluation happens in WebAssembly (extremely fast).

**Q: What's a "filter bubble"?**

A: When an algorithm only shows you content similar to what you've clicked before, you end up in a "bubble" - never seeing opposing views or new topics. Algorithm Shield pops that bubble.

**Q: Is this legal?**

A: Yes. You're just using a browser extension to automate your own browsing. No different from using bookmarks or browser scripts.

== Philosophy

**The internet should expand your worldview, not narrow it.**

Algorithms optimize for engagement. Engagement = clicks. Clicks = showing you more of what you already like. This creates filter bubbles, echo chambers, and polarization - not as side effects, but as **core features** of engagement optimization.

The result? We're losing our ability to understand people who think differently. Shared reality fractures. Democratic discourse becomes impossible when we can't even agree on what's true.

**Algorithm Shield doesn't fight the algorithm - it confuses it.**

By making your behavior unpredictable, you become unprofileable. And when you're unprofileable, the algorithm has to show you a diversity of content. You're not hiding - you're **refusing to be predictable**.

**The membrane operates at every layer.**

We use formal verification (Idris2 + proven library) to mathematically prove our code cannot crash or leak data. No "we think it's safe" - we have mathematical proof. Future versions integrate Ephapax (Coq-proven memory safety), Svalinn/Vörðr (verified containers), and Cerro Torre (cryptographic provenance).

**Four layers of mathematical proof.** This isn't just good engineering - it's a statement that tools for cognitive autonomy deserve the same rigor as safety-critical systems.

**Respect for human agency is non-negotiable.**

This tool asks permission. It explains its actions. It lets you stay in control. Because the alternative - replacing algorithmic manipulation with a different kind of manipulation - would miss the point entirely.

The goal isn't to automate your way out of filter bubbles. It's to give you **the tools to cross boundaries intentionally**, while staying aware of what you're doing and why.
