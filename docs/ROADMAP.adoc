== Open Questions (Affect Roadmap)

=== Technical
1. Can we avoid bot detection long-term? (Affects all versions)
2. Will WASM performance be acceptable? (Affects v0.5)
3. Can cross-platform abstraction hold? (Affects v1.0)

=== Legal/Ethical
1. Do we need ToS compliance review? (Before v1.0)
2. Is this "hacking" platforms? (Philosophy, ongoing)
3. What if platforms explicitly ban this? (Risk mitigation)

=== Social
1. Will users adopt behavioral polymorphism? (UX research, v1.0)
2. Is there demand for persona marketplace? (v2.0 decision point)
3. Will community contribute lenses/personas? (v5.0 assumption)

=== Economic
1. How is development funded? (FOSS, grants, donations?)
2. Who pays for sync/federation infra? (v2.0+)
3. Is this a commons or a business? (Governance decision)
